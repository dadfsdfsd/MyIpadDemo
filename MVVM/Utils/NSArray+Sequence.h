 the given block once for each object.
 
 Enumeration will occur on appropriate background queues. This
 will have a noticeable speed increase, especially on dual-core
 devices, but you *must* be aware of the thread safety of the
 objects you message from within the block. Be aware that the
 order of objects is not necessarily the order each block will
 be called in.

/** Arbitrarily accumulate objects using a block.
 
 The concept of this selector is difficult to illustrate in words. The sum can
 be any NSObject, including (but not limited to) a string, number, or value.
 
 For example, you can concentate the strings in an array:
 NSString *concentrated = [stringArray reduce:@"" withBlock:^id(id sum, id obj) {
 return [sum stringByAppendingString:obj];
 }];
 
 You can also do something like summing the lengths of strings in an array:
 NSUInteger value = [[[stringArray reduce:nil withBlock:^id(id sum, id obj) {
 return @([sum integerValue] + obj.length);
 }]] unsignedIntegerValue];
 
 @param initial The value of the reduction at its start.
 @param block A block that takes the current sum and the next object to return the new sum.
 @return An accumulated value.

 NSArray *peoples = @[p1, p2, p3];
 NSInteger totalAge = 0;

 We can use a block to make it simpler:

/** Loops through an array to find whether any object matches the block.
 
 This method is similar to the Scala list `exists`. It is functionally
 identical to match: but returns a `BOOL` instead. It is not recommended
 to use any: as a check condition before executing match:, since it would
 require two loops through the array.
 
 For example, you can find if a string in an array starts with a certain letter:
 
 NSString *letter = @"A";
 BOOL containsLetter = [stringArray any:^(id obj) {
 return [obj hasPrefix:@"A"];
